# Open source CAD Software's searching For the Automatic Tooth Comparing

I am trying to do the Automatic Tooth's CAD Compare for Tooth crowns preparation. One software for this work is the [**PrepCheck** software][1] and do it like shown below (YouTube video)][6]

[![enter image description here][7]][7]

So it must be done by on the 32 Constant Geometrical characteristic for the teeth as said [here][4].

If **possible**, I am asking about finding the **best Open source CAD compare Software** to do this automatic calculation?


I guess the [**CloudCompare**][8] could be a **candidate**, For doing it. For this, it needs to write some scripts for:

 1.  Finding every one of 32 tooth locations by [**Artificial
    intelligence CAD Segmentation**][9] (like said [here][10] and
    [here][11]) or ...,
    
 
 2. Doing **the compare** by some **automatic scripts for that location** in
        STL file.

So, **The** **question** is for **finding the proper software to do this procedure on it** (blender or  ...), by finding some **popular Open source CAD software** for this calculation I could find some **sample codes** via [GitHub][12] and [Paperswithcode][13] site, **better**.


**Note**:

Excuse me, If having too much information. This is because, I have tried to ask this question as a **guideline** to do this project, for myself or others (by adding the search links and ...), 

Thanks.
