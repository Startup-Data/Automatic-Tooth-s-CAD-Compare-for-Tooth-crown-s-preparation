# Automatic-Tooth-s-CAD-Compare-for-Tooth-crown-s-preparation

I am trying to do the Automatic Tooth's CAD Compare for Tooth crown's preparation. One software for this work is the [**PrepCheck** software][1] and do it like shown below ([YouTube video][6]).

[![enter image description here][7]][7]

So it must be done by on the 32 Constant Geometrical characteristic for the teeth as said [here][4].


# TODO List:

### 1- find the Proper software with community to gather the written python code (AI CAD Segmentation part) and do it by the Target software's modules or by finding the written scripts, or writing the python scripts (!)([Asked here](https://engineering.stackexchange.com/questions/40966/trying-to-find-proper-open-source-cad-software-for-the-automatic-tooth-comparing)).

 - 1-1- Try to Check how to do it one cloudcompare:
   
 - 1-2- Try to Check how to do it one Blender:

### 2- The AI CAD secretions part:

I guess the Colab Codes could be found at These pages:

 - [3D Machine
   Learning](https://github.com/timzhang642/3D-Machine-Learning)
 - [Autonomous Geometry Processing Using Machine Learning and
   Forge](https://medium.com/autodesk-university/autonomous-geometry-processing-using-machine-learning-and-forge-3b89b40e97cb)

## Suggestions for some new project:

  1- making the teeth STL files by the teeth PNG photo like is done for face here:

 - 1-1- [MeInGame: Create a Game Character Face from a Single
   Portrait]https://github.com/So-AI-love/MeInGame)
   
 - 1-2- [Github search for 3d face reconstruction   
   projects](https://github.com/topics/3d-face-reconstruction)

  2- making the Teeth STL files from the X-Ray photos like this paper and its GitHub codes:

    

 - 2-1- [Oral-3D: Reconstructing the 3D Bone Structure of Oral Cavity
   from 2D Panoramic
   X-ray](https://deepai.org/publication/oral-3d-reconstructing-the-3d-bone-structure-of-oral-cavity-from-2d-panoramic-x-ray)

I guess the [CloudCompare][8] is a good candidate. For doing it, I need writing some scripts to find every of 32 teeth locations by [Artificial intelligence CAD Segmentation ][9] (like said [here][10] and [here][11]) or ..., and cutting the result from the main STL file and do the compare by some automatic scripts.

So, the main question is about finding the proper software to do this procedure on it (blender or  ...), so by finding some popular Open source software for this calculation I could find some sample code via [GitHub][12] and [Paperswithcode][13] site, better.
